# monster
This is a fun project I did with my 9 year old son to show him coding could be a lot of fun. Javascript-based animation was used to draw a monster head. My son helped design the monster's nose and mouth. He picked the eye color as well.  He begged me to put it up online so that his friends can take a look and play with the monster. Take a look and move the monster [here](https://jz200.github.io/monster "Move the monster").
